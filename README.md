EuroEditor - at the time of writing - is a not finished product. Inspired by [Libreoffice - Writer ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice_Writer "LibreOffice Writer - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia").

This will be the default web-based editor of [EuroCMS](https://github.com/blade1989/EuroCMS)!


##Features
Some features that still need some polishing:

 - Rich Text Editing.
 - Source code editing.
 - Mark Down editing.
